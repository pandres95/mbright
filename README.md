# MBright

Randomly modifies screen brightness in OS X. Needs [screenbrightness](https://github.com/jmstacey/screenbrightness) installed to work.

Just download it, enable execution and enjoy.

```bash
$ cd mbright
$ chmod +x mbright
$ sudo mv mbright /usr/bin
$ mbright
```
# Relase Notes

I was really drunk while writing this script, so don't use it in production.
